//Write algorithm that checks two numbers and print maximum of Two numbers//
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n1, n2
Step 3: If n1 is greater than n2, 
		Display "n1 is Maximum"
	else
		Display "n2 is Maximum"
Step 4: Stop

//Write an Algorithm that checks two numbers and print minimum of Two numbers
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the two numbers and store them in a and b.
Step 3: Check if a < b
Step 4: If true then print a and goto step 6
Step 5: If false then print b
Step 6: Stop

//Write an Algorithm that checks two numbers and print average of Two numbers
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Input number1, number2
Step 3 : sum = 0 ; average = 0
Step 4 : Calculate sum = (number1 + number2)
Step 5 : Average = sum / 2
Step 6 : Print average of two numbers
Step 7 : Stop
